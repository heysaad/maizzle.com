# Build errors

Maizzle will throw an error when a build error occurs.

You may configure how build errors are handled when developing with the CLI commands, by adding a `build.fail` key to your config:

```js [config.js]
module.exports = {
  build : {
    fail: 'silent' // or 'verbose'
  }
}
```

<Alert>Omitting it or using any other value will throw an error (log stack trace and exit script).</Alert>

## Fail

Type: String\
Default: `undefined`

### silent

`silent` will just log the paths to the files it failed build.

### verbose

`verbose` will additionally log the error stack trace.
